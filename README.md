# Image Histogram Analysis and Enhancement
## Overview
This project focuses on histogram analysis techniques for image processing, specifically for contrast enhancement. The goal is to analyze an image’s histogram and use this information to modify and improve its appearance. By leveraging slope-based and percentage-based methods, we determine the necessary parameters for two key enhancement techniques:

Contrast Stretching
Histogram Equalization
## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:

Calculate Histograms

Compute the image histogram.
Compute the cumulative histogram.
Analyze the Histogram

Determine the color covering percentage.
Identify the maximal slope for parameter selection.
Modify the Histogram

Apply Contrast Stretching to enhance contrast dynamically.
Apply Histogram Equalization to redistribute intensity levels for better visual clarity.
## Implementation Details
Given an input image, the system first extracts histogram-related data, then applies the selected enhancement techniques based on computed parameters. The modifications aim to improve the image’s contrast while preserving important details.

## Expected Outcomes
By implementing these techniques, the processed images should exhibit improved visibility and better contrast distribution. The project serves as a practical exploration of histogram-based image enhancement methods.
